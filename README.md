## Overview

### The challenge

Build out a multi-page portfolio website and get it looking as close to the reference design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

I first completed the design in plain HTML and SASS. Once those designs were complete, I translated them for React and Next.js.

This is my first Next.js application and haven't written anything in React in just under two years. While this was mostly just a tranlation of the HTML designs to React, the navigation and form were areas that provided challenges.

I originally had plans to use CSS/SCSS modules when moving to Next.js, but it would make more sense to start the design in Next than to try to tranlate what I had already completed for the HTML/SASS version of this project. AS a result, I just used a global stylesheet instead of SCSS modules.
