## Overview

### The challenge

Build out a multi-page portfolio website and get it looking as close to the reference design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
